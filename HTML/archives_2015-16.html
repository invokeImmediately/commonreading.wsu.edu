<h2>Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, by Bryan Stevenson</h2>
<hr>
<h4><a href="https://commonreading.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2015/04/JustMercy-web.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-549 alignright" src="https://commonreading.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2015/04/JustMercy-web-396x645.jpg" alt="JustMercy-web" width="201" height="344" /></a>WSU’s 2015-16 Common Reading book used by thousands of WSU first-year and other students in classes and beyond.</h4>
<h6>Selection</h6>
<p>WSU Provost and Executive Vice President Daniel J. Bernardo announced on April 9, 2015 that the next Common Reading book selected would be<em> Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption</em>, by Bryan Stevenson.  Bernardo commented he found the selection to be “well written and authored by someone who will certainly continue to be a relevant figure in the social justice space for years to come.” The Common Reading Selection Committee had provided three books to the Provost for consideration from 25 books nominated by the WSU community and beyond.<em> Just Mercy</em>, Bernardo said, "addresses the important social issue of criminal justice and its interaction with racial discrimination in our country."</p>
<h6>Two-Year Theme: "Social justice and Leadership"</h6>
<p>For the first time in the nine-year-history of the Common Reading Program, a thematic approach was applied. The books nominated for the 2015-16 year needed to reflect "social justice and leadership."  Following a theme would allow students and professors to go into greater depth and think broadly about big issues. The theme would last two years, then be replaced by a new theme. </p>
<h6>Availability of Limited Desk Copies</h6>
<p>Examination copies of the book were available tofaculty who were considering using the book <em>Just Mercy</em> in their classes or programs in 2015-16.</p>
<h6>Used in Classes, Programming</h6>
<p>Pullman students in first-year and other courses used the <em>Just Mercy</em> throughout the 2015-16 academic year. Topics from it were raised in classes, guest lectures, and outside programming to inspire academic discussions between and among students and faculty across the disciplines. Robust supplementary programming enhanced topics from the book and included faculty and guest-expert lectures, film showing, hands-on activities, and shared events with campus partners.</p>
<h6>Assessment of the Program</h6>
<p>The WSU Common Reading Program undergoes assessment reviews following the close of each academic year in which a book was used in classes and programming.  The assessment reports for 2015-16 and the use of <em>Just Mercy</em>, and other common readings, are available on the <a href="https://commonreading.wsu.edu/assessment-reports/">assessment webpage</a> of this site.</p>
<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p><img id="yui_3_5_1_4_1431979533486_695" class=" alignleft" src="http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2014/10/19/bryan-stevenson----credit-nina-subin_custom-85f8dbb86c7cfa2dd19f0a4a22a9a0d793c5c9e8-s800-c15.jpg" alt="" width="158" height="238" />Social justice activist, attorney, and author of<em> Just Mercy </em>Bryan Stevenson is the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Ala.  He has “won relief for dozens of condemned prisoners, argued five times before the U.S. Supreme Court, and won national acclaim for his work challenging bias against the poor and people of color.” He has argued cases to keep children out of adult jails and prisons.</p>
<p>Stevenson was described by South African social rights activist Desmond Tutu as “America’s young Nelson Mandela” and likened by author John Grisham to Atticus Finch, the heroic fictional lawyer in Harper Lee’s <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> classic American novel.</p>
<p>Stevenson delivered the ninth annual <strong>Common Reading Invited Lecture</strong> at Beasley Coliseum on the Pullman campus Dec. 1, 2015. He called on listeners in the audience to "have a voice and take action" when they believe an injustice has been done, or to support a cause that matters to them. He signed books for readers following the well-attended presentation.</p>
<p><strong><em>“We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community…I believe it’s necessary to recognize that we all need mercy, we all need justice, and – perhaps – we all need some measure of unmerited grace.” – Bryan Stevenson</em></strong></p>
<h2>About the Book</h2>
<p>Published in October 2014 by Spiegel &amp; Grau, an imprint of Random House, <em>Just Mercy</em> is nonfiction and written in first person by attorney Stevenson. Many of his cases are profiled in <em>Just Mercy</em>. In it, he calls for compassion in the pursuit of justice. "My work with the poor and the incarcerated has persuaded me that the opposite of poverty is not wealth...[it] is justice," he wrote in the introduction to the book.</p>
<p>In addition to WSU, the book has been used at many universities and schools as a common reading.</p>

	This exhibit features art created at California's New Folsom Prison near Sacramento between 1994-2014 by inmates participating in the state's Arts in Corrections Program (AIC). None had formal art training before joining AIC classes. AIC is a statewide, state-funded program that brings to inmates professional arts instruction in visual, performing, literary, and media into California prisons. The exhibit has been curated by WSU English faculty member Anna Plemons, who studies prison writing programs and has taught creative nonfiction at New Folsom since 2009. The art will be displayed through Feb. 2016; faculty wishing to arrange a class visit should contact the Dept. of English. <strong><i>Common Reading Stamp available at the Sept. 29 reception only.</i></strong></p>
<h5>Week of Welcome, Aug. 17-21 (workshop sessions; see programming schedule)</h5>
<p><strong>Power and Privilege 101: Marc Robinson and Jenne Schmidt, WSU Office of Diversity Education</strong><br />
	This workshop introduces the concepts of power, identity, and privilege using engaging activities and popular culture media. Co-facilitated by Diversity Education’s social justice peer educators, participants will explore their own identities and avenues to get involved in social justice on campus.</p>
<p><strong>A Compass to Explore the Common Reading, <i>Just Mercy</i></strong>:<strong> Marc Robinson and Jenne Schmidt, WSU Office of Diversity Education</strong><br />
	Using this year’s Common Reading book, <i>Just Mercy</i>, by Brian Stevenson, as the foundation, this workshop explores various social issues, including race, social class, inequality, history, and justice, which underpin the text. This interactive workshop uses activities, video clips, and small group discussions; it provides students with tools to engage in Common Reading conversations about these issues.</p>
<h5>Tues., Aug. 25, 7- 9 p.m., CUE 203</h5>
<p><strong>Screening of To Kill a Mockingbird (1962, 129 minutes) </strong><em>(Hosted by the Common Reading Program)</em><br />
	Monroeville, Ala., is the home town of celebrated author Harper Lee and the basis for the fictional town of Maycomb in her classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird. It is also the location where Walter McMillian was unjustly accused, tried for murder, incarcerated, and sentenced to death for killing a white woman. Bryan Stevenson, the author of <i>Just Mercy</i>, took on the case postconviction to exonerate McMillian, by proving that witnesses had lied on the stand and the prosecution had illegally suppressed exculpatory evidence. McMillian’s conviction was overturned and he was released in March 2003 after spending six years on death row for a crime he did not commit.<br />
	Stevenson is attributed with saying that while Monroeville proudly celebrates its connection to the novel and film of To Kill a Mockingbird, the town remained blind to contemporary racial bias and injustices in its administration of justice. “We start this year’s series with a screening of this classic film to provide the context and story that this year’s common reading will challenge and extend,” says Karen Weathermon, co-director of the Common Reading. <strong><i>Common Reading Stamp available.</i></strong></p>
<h5>Mon., Aug. 31, Noon-1:00 p.m., Bryan Hall 308</h5>
<p><strong>Leslie McCall on "The Undeserving Rich: American Beliefs About Inequality" </strong><em>(Hosted by the Thomas S. Foley Institute for Public Policy and Public Service's Coffee &amp; Politics Series)</em><br />
	Leslie McCall, author and Northwestern University professor of sociology and political science, will discuss American views about income inequality, economic beliefs, and what she believes to be the era of rising inquality. In her latest book,<em> The Undeserving Rich: American Beliefs About Inequality, Opportunity, and Redistribution</em>, McCall challenges widespread assumptions and claims that Americans have desired less inequality for decades. <strong><i>Common Reading Stamp available</i>.</strong></p>
<h4 id="september">September 2015</h4>
<h5>Tues., Sept. 1, 4:30-5:30 p.m., CUE 203</h5>
<p><strong>Faith Lutze on “The Evolving American Prison: Executing the Ideals of Justice, Mercy, and Redemption” </strong><i>(Hosted by the Common Reading Program)</i><br />
	Faith Lutze is a professor in the WSU Dept. of Criminal Justice and Criminology. Prisons in the United States have a long history of adapting to shifting notions of justice, mercy, and redemption. Criminal justice and prison leaders are expected to translate philosophy into reality for both staff and offenders. Historical and contemporary research shows there is often a gap between our intentions (conscience) as a society and the reality of our practices (action). This presentation illustrates both the good and the bad in our use of prisons to achieve criminal justice goals. <strong><i>Common Reading Stamp available.</i></strong></p>
<h5>Tues., Sept. 8, 7 p.m., CUE 203</h5>
<p><strong>Brian Kemp on "From Mendel's Pea Plants to DNA Fingerprinting: How one 19th century monk's observations in the garden form the basis for individual identification in the forensic sciences today" </strong><i>(Hosted by the Common Reading Program)</i><br />
	Brian Kemp, associate professor in the WSU Dept. of Anthropology and the School of Biological Sciences, will introduce the audience to DNA and the structure of the human genome. What is DNA and what does it do? How do we study it? These topics will be addressed in the context of the discovery of the principles of inheritance by Gregor Mendel in his pea plant garden in the 1860s. Beyond being of tremendous historical relevance, Mendel's observations form the basis today for DNA fingerprinting. Among its many uses, DNA analysis now is a central tool in forensic science, both for the trial of new cases and for the retrial of old cases that predate the use of DNA evidence. By the end of the lecture, audience members will have a full understanding how DNA is used to identify individuals. No prior knowledge is needed! <strong><i>Common Reading Stamp available.</i></strong></p>
<h5>Thurs., Sept. 10, 5:30 p.m., CUE 203</h5>
<p><strong>Arlene Dávila on “El Mall: The Class and Spatial Politics of Shopping Malls in LA”  </strong><i>(Hosted by the Center for Critical Culture, Gender, and Race Studies, and co-sponsors)</i><br />

Her work focuses on the global political economy of Latino/Latin American cultures, with a focus on Puerto Ricans in the United States. Her most recent publications include <em>Culture Works: Space, Value, and Mobility Across the Neoliberal Americas</em> and other books focusing on comparative race/ethnic studies, urban studies, and media and visual studies. <strong><i>Common Reading Stamp available.</i></strong></p>
<h5>Tues., Sept. 15, 7 p.m., CUE 203</h5>
<p><strong>"Broken on All Sides: Race, Mass Incarceration, and New Visions for Criminal Justice in the U.S."  </strong><em>(Film showing hosted by the Common Reading Program)</em><br />
	This documentary centers around author and law professor Michelle Alexander’s theory, presented in her book <em>The New Jim Crow</em>, that mass incarceration is a new caste system in America that is enacted through the rise of the drug war, “tough on crime” policies, discretion and bias in policing and sentencing, and the legal discrimination of those with criminal records in almost every aspect of citizenship. See <a href="http://brokenonallsides.com">http://brokenonallsides.com</a> for more on this film. <strong><i>Common Reading Stamp available.</i></strong></p>
<h5>Fri., Sept. 18, 2:00 p.m., CUE 518</h5>

	Jeff Guillory, WSU Director of Diversity Education, will discuss his experiences growing up in the Jim Crow south during the 1950s and 1960s, and the effect this system had on him at each stage of his formative years. It is a personal story that provides the listener with an immersion experience with hate and its far-reaching effects on a young man’s view of himself, authority, race, education, and law enforcement until the sudden shock of his first encounter with integration turns everything upside down. <strong><i>Common Reading Stamp available.</i></strong></p>
<h5>Mon., Sept. 28, 7:00-8:30 p.m., Todd 130</h5>
<p><strong>"At Night I Fly"  </strong>(Film showing)<br />
	"At Night I Fly" is an internationally-acclaimed film about the New Folsom maximum-security prison in California. Its U.S. début was at the 2013 Fortnight Film Festival at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The website for the film says “...men at (New Folsom) let us see their world...(which is) less about dangerous drama and more, as one of them describes, about isolation. About closure of both the mind and the heart. And the spirit." This intimate documentary shows prisoners, most serving a life sentence, who refuse such closure and instead work to uncover and express themselves. Their primary tool is making art and the film takes us to New Folsom's Arts in Corrections' room, to prison poetry readings, gospel choirs, blues guitar on the yard, and to many more scenes of creation. The film "shows the artistic and human journey these men take, as well as the need that fuels it, and the beauty and pain encountered along the way.”  Following the showing there will be a question-and-answer session with Jim Carlson, California's Arts in Corrections (AIC) Program former director, who appears in the film. <em><strong>Common Reading Stamp available.</strong></em></p>
<h5>Tues., Sept. 29, 5:00-6:30 p.m., Bundy Reading Room in Avery Hall</h5>
<p><strong>"Outsider Art: Work from New Folsom Prison, 1994-2014"  </strong><em>(Open house for art exhibit, hosted by the WSU Dept. of English and curated by Anna Plemons)</em><br />
	The exhibit features art works created at New Folsom Prison between 1994-2014 by incarcerated artists participating in the California Arts in Corrections Program (AIC). None of the artists whose work is displayed had formal art training before joining AIC classes. The English Department offers this exhibit in conjunction with the WSU Common Reading program’s 2015-16 selection of the book <em>Just Mercy</em>, by Bryan Stevenson. Stevenson’s book, and his work as the founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, resonates with the mission of AIC in that both projects challenge deeply-held stereotypes about incarcerated people. Both projects also press important and timely questions about what it means to be human and what the practice of mass incarceration says about American society. <strong><i>Common Reading Stamp available</i> at the open house only.</strong><br />
	The exhibit is presented by English faculty member Anna Plemons who studies prison writing programs and has taught creative nonfiction at New Folsom since 2009; specific inquiries about the show can by sent to her at aplemons@wsu.edu. <em>The exhibit will be on display in the Bundy Reading Room until March 2016. If you are unable to attend the exhibit open house on Sept. 29, reservations to view the show can be made by contacting English at 509-335-2581.</em><br />

<h5>Tues., Sept. 29, 7:00 p.m., Todd 216</h5>
<p><strong>Carol Hinds on “Re-imagining Rehabilitation: A Mother’s Story”  </strong><i>(Sponsored by the WSU Dept. of English)</i><br />
	Carol Hinds is the parent of an inmate at California State Prison-Sacramento (New Folsom Prison) and has served as secretary on the prison’s Inmate Family Council for the past 14 years. Her son is serving a 25-to-life sentence through 2025. In addition to her work with the Council effecting policy change and supporting inmate families, she has spoken before the California legislature and at national conferences, sharing her personal story about the positive and healing effects that art, music, and creative writing have had on her son and others in the prison. Hinds has become a strong advocate for prison arts programs and her story challenges audiences to think broadly about what an agenda for restorative justice might look like. She is cited in<em> Paths of Discovery: Arts Practice and Its Impact in California Prison</em> (Brewster 2012). <strong><i>Common Reading Stamp available.</i></strong></p>

<h5>Mon., Oct. 5 through Fri., Oct. 9, Bins in Holland/Terrell Library, Owen Science and Engineering Library, and the Student Recreation Center</h5>
<p><strong>"Books for Prisoners"  </strong><em>(Donation drive, organized by WSU Libraries and the Center for Civic Engagement)</em><br />
	A book drive Oct. 5-16 will benefit inmates of Washington State Penitentiary. The drive is part of a related exhibit in Terrell Library on programs that provide free books to prisoners and this year’s Common Reading book “Just Mercy,” by Bryan Stevenson.<br />
	“The book drive and exhibit give people a chance to not only learn about how important books-to-prisoners programs are, but also provide the opportunity to make a difference,” said Holly Luetkenhaus, WSU instruction librarian and exhibit organizer. “Having books available through libraries and book stores is something many of us take for granted, but those who are incarcerated have limited access to education and reading material. This book drive is one way to help provide these resources to those who otherwise might have no access to them.<br />
	"We know that formal education programs in prisons have declined in recent years, making the availability of books even more important,” said Melanie Brown, director of the WSU Center for Civic Engagement. “Donating a book or two is a small but meaningful act.”<br />
	Gently used novels, chess books, dictionaries and GED test preparation books are frequently requested by inmates. Also popular are thesauruses, African American history and fiction, Native American studies, legal materials, vocational-technical manuals, politics, anthropology, art and drawing books (including blank notebooks) and books on paranormal phenomena. Donors are asked to NOT include spiral-bound or hardback books, romance novels or books published before 1984 (binding glue used before that year becomes brittle, causing books to fall apart).<br />
	Collections bins will be located in Holland/Terrell Library, Owen Science and Engineering Library and the Student Recreation Center.<br />
	For more information about the book drive, please contact Luetkenhaus at 509-335-4667 or holly.luetkenhaus@wsu.edu.</p>

<p><strong>Faith Lutz leads discussion on "College Behind Bars: Why Educate Inmates?"  </strong><em>(Hosted by the Public Square Program in the Center for Civic Education)</em><br />
	Prison education programs have been shown to have positive outcomes. When education programs are implemented in prisons, inmates are significantly less likely to become repeat offenders and are more likely to find stable employment after release. Despite these benefits, the number of education programs available in US prisons has dropped from 350 postsecondary programs in 1990 to only 12 by 2005.<br />
	Why aren’t we prioritizing education in prisons when the research shows that it reduces repeat crime? What can be done to change this?<br />
	Dept. of Criminal Justice and Criminology Professor Faith Lutze will lead the discussion with students, faculty, staff, and community members. Students can register for this event on CougSync, and Global Campus and urban campus students are invited to join the discussion via live stream on CCE's YouTube channel.

<p><strong>Todd Butler (English) on "Deciding for Death: Emotions and the Video 'Victim-Impact Statement'"  </strong><em>(Hosted by the Common Reading Program)</em><br />
	In the United States, a death sentence requires more than a conviction. Either a jury or a judge must also weigh separately the presence or aggravating factors to the crime, a process which in most states allows victims the opportunity to make what are often emotion-filled statements regarding the impact of a particular crime upon family, friends, and society. Drawing upon diverse sources, Butler, associate professor in the WSU department of English, examines just how those emotions work upon a jury’s decision-making process, what their importance is, what their dangers are, and what happens when those victim-impact statements become digital productions, complete with not just words but sound and visual imagery. <em><strong>Common Reading stamp available. </strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Stephen James and Lois James (Criminal Justice, Sleep Performance Center) on "Fatigue, Distraction, and Bias: What They Mean for Law Enforcement and the Communities They Serve"  </strong><em>(Hosted by the Common Reading Program) </em><br />
	Stephen James and Lois James, both of whom are researchers in WSU’s Sleep and Performance Research Center, say that police officers are the gatekeepers to the criminal justice system. Although bound by laws that dictate who they should and shouldn’t arrest, they are still relatively autonomous agents. As such, in the pursuit of a fair and just system, it is critical that they do not let their personal frustrations or biases influence how they treat the people they are sworn to protect and serve. However, police officers are human beings, and have the same physical and mental limitations as the rest of us. Throughout this talk, the James's will discuss several pivotal problems facing the police profession today: chronic shift-work- related fatigue, dangerous distracted-riving conditions, and implicit racial biases. They will examine the impact of these problems across a range of policing tasks, from deadly force judgement and decision making, patrol driving, and tactical social interaction. They will invite the audience to consider how police fatigue, distraction, and bias erodes progress toward a “just and merciful” criminal justice system. They will also provide insight into what police departments can do to safeguard against these corrosive effects <em><strong>Common Reading stamp available.</strong></em>March 2016</p>

<p><strong>Global Case Final Competition  </strong><em>(Opening remarks by a U.N. committee executive followed by top five teams' presentations; hosted by WSU International Programs)</em><br />
	Since spring 2011, graduate and undergraduate students have applied to participate in this popular annual tradition that counts on teamwork to develop solutions to global problems. Out of 20 participating teams, the top five finalists present their proposals at a Mom's Weekend forum to judges and the public; the winning team gets scholarships to travel to the location of the "case" to present their work to an official organization. In 2015, for example, the winning team plus faculty representatives went to Brazil to promote community responsibility toward the environment. That year, the Global Case was linked to the 2014-15 Common Reading book, <em>Garbology</em>, by Edward Humes.<br />
	For this 2016 competition, teams have worked again on a topic related to the year's common reading book, "Just Mercy," by Bryan Stevenson: finding solutions to real cases of arbitrary detention in the U.S. Their proposals will inform the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention's (WGAD) report to the U.S. and in so doing, affect how it may approach future cases around the world. The winner of the competition will be invited to provide their solutions to the WGAD in Geneva, Switzerland, in November.<br />
	Roland Adjovi, professor and second vice chair of the WGAD, will deliver opening remarks for the WSU competition. WGAD was established in 1991 by the United Nations to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily that may be in violation of the U.N.’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <strong><em>Common Reading stamp available--note that this is a two-hour event.<br />

<h5>WSU Libraries' "Frontline" Documentaries</h5>
<p>A number of "Frontline" documentaries from television and additional resources on criminal justice are available online at http://<a href="http://www.pbs.org">www.pbs.org. </a>The archive includes the search term “criminal justice.” Eight of these documentaries are:</p>
<ul>

	<li><strong> " Stick-up Kid"</strong> (2014, 28 min) on what happens when juvenile offenders placed into adult prisons, featuring the story of Alonza Thomas who served a 13-year sentence for a botched armed robbery. Thomas is the older brother of NFL safety Phillip Thomas.</li>
	<li><strong>"The New Asylums"</strong> (2005, 116 min) on nearly 500,000 persons with mental illness serving time in U.S. jails and prisons; and The Released (2009, 54 min), a follow-up documentary which looks at what happens to the mentally ill after they are released, profiling the fates of some of those covered in the 2005 documentary; and <strong>"The Released"</strong> (2009, 54 min), a follow-up documentary looking at what happens to the mentally ill after they are released , profiling the fates of some of those covered in "The New Asylums."</li>
	<li><strong>"Lost in Detention"</strong> (2011, 53 min) on the detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants. (Also available on DVD from WSU-Vancouver.)</li>
	<li><strong>"Prison State"</strong> (2014,82 min), which follows the path of four people caught up in the cycle of Kentucky’s criminal justice system.

The website includes a 9-minute encapsulation of one of the teenage girl’s stories that would be easy to use in a classroom setting, as well as a variety of other resources. This film is one of a pair of films on the criminal justice system; the second, "<strong>Solitary Nation"</strong> (53 min) is a shocking and brutal look at solitary confinement in a Maine prison, available at the same website.</li>
	<li>"<strong>Death by Fire"</strong> (2010, 53 min) on the execution of Cameron Todd Willingham and the death penalty debate.</li>
</ul>
<h5>WSU Libraries' Videos</h5>
<ul>
	<li><strong>"Out in the Night"</strong>(2014), Dir. Blair Doroshwalther, 75 min., WSU DVD 4600 In 2006, under the neon lights of a gay-friendly neighborhood in New York City, a group of African-American lesbians were violently threatened by a man on the street.  The women fought back and were later charged with gang assault and attempted murder. The tabloids quickly dubbed them a gang of “Killer Lesbians” and a “Wolf Pack.” Three pleaded guilty to avoid a trial, but the remaining four maintained their innocence. This award-winning documentary examines the sensational case and the women’s uphill battle, revealing the role that race, gender, and sexuality play in our criminal justice system.</li>
	<li><strong>"Slavery by Another Name"</strong>(2012), Dir. Sam Pollard, 90 min., WSU DVD 4599  This film challenges one of our country’s most cherished assumptions: the belief that slavery ended with Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. Spanning history over eight decades (1865-1945), this documentary recounts how the criminal justice system allowed insidious new forms of forced labor to emerge in the American South that kept hundreds of thousands of African-Americans in bondage. The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book by <em>Wall Street Journal</em> writer Douglas Blackman, <em>Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil Way to World War II</em>. See <a href="http://www.slaverybyanothername.com/pbs-film/">http://www.slaverybyanothername.com/pbs-film/</a> for additional resources and information.</li>
	<li><strong>"Broken on All Sides: Race, Mass Incarceration, and New Visions for Criminal Justice in the U.S." </strong>(2013), Dir. Matthew Pillisher, 68 min, WSU DVD 3905 This documentary centers around author Michelle Alexander’s theory, presented in her groundbreaking book <em>The New Jim Crow</em>: mass incarceration is a new caste system in America that is enacted through the rise of the drug war, “tough on crime” policies, discretion and bias in policing and sentencing, and the legal discrimination of those with criminal records in almost every aspect of citizenship. See <a href="http://brokenonallsides.com">http://brokenonallsides.com</a> for more on this film.</li>
	<li><strong>"The House I Live In" </strong>(2013), Dir. Eugene Jarecki, 108 min, WSU DVD 4448  Winner of the Grand Jury Prize for Documentaries at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, this documentary by award-winning filmmaker Eugene Jarecki traces the history of the drug war to examine the causes and effects of the drug laws from multiple perspectives—dealers, users, families, guards, lawyers, and judges. The film includes commentary by David Simon, creator of <em>The Wire;</em> sociologist and WSU alumnus William Julius Wilson; and Michelle Alexander, author of <em>The New Jim Crow</em>. Special features include 2-to-3-minute spots on overcrowding, self-soothing, private prisons, jury nullification, and how work defines us. See <a href="http://www.thehuseilivein.org">www.thehouseilivein.org</a> for additional resources.</li>
	<li><strong>"To Kill a Mockingbird"</strong>(1963), Dir. Robert Mulligan, 129 min, WSU DVD 2311Based on Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize winning novel of 1961, the film portrays Atticus Finch, a lawyer in a racially divided Alabama town in the 1930s. Finch, whose portrayal by Gregory Peck earned him an Academy Award, agrees to defend Tom Robinson, a young black man accused of raping a white woman. Considered a classic American film, <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> is connected as well to Bryan Stevenson’s <em>Just Mercy</em>. Monroeville, Ala., the home town of Harper Lee and the basis for the fictional town of Maycomb that is the setting for <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, is also the location where Stevenson’s death-row client Walter McMillian was unjustly accused and tried for murder of a white girl. Stevenson helped to exonerate McMillian, who was released from prison in 2003 after six years on death row. Stevenson points out that while Monroeville proudly celebrates its connection to the novel and film <em>To Kill a Mockingbird,</em> even turning the courthouse into a museum and hosting an annual performance of a theatrical version of the story, the town remained blind to contemporary racial injustices in its administration of justice.</li>
