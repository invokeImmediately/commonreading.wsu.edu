<h2>Garbology: Our Dirty Love Affair With Trash</h2>
<hr />
<h3 class="about-the-author">The Author</h3>
<p><img id="yui_3_5_1_4_1431973669727_836" class=" alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/05/photo_garbology_Edward-Humes.jpg" width="238" height="237" /><strong>Edward Humes</strong> is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and non-fiction writer.</p>
<p>Humes was born in Philadelphia and attended Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In 1989 he received the Pulitzer Prize for specialized reporting for investigative stories he wrote about the United States military for the Orange County Register. Afterward, he began writing non-fiction books.</p>
<p>Humes is the author of 13 nonfiction books, including the bestselling "Mississippi Mud"; "No Matter How Loud I Shout"; "Baby E.R."; "A Man and His Mountain"; and "Garbology," a popular selection for the First Year Experience program on college campuses.</p>
<p>In 2001, Humes spent a year teaching a writing workshop at Whitney High School in Cerritos, California, a middle-class Los Angeles suburb. His observations while at the school led to his narrative non-fiction book <em>School of Dreams</em>, published in 2004.</p>
<p>Humes is a contributing writer for Sierra Magazine, California Lawyer and Los Angeles magazine, among other publications. He is married to journalist and author Donna Wares and lives in Southern California.</p>
<h3 class="about-the-book">The Book</h3>
<p><strong id="yui_3_8_1_1_1401227212158_1143">A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist takes readers on a surprising tour of America’s biggest export, our most prodigious product, and our greatest legacy: our trash.</strong></p>
<p>The average American produces 102 tons of garbage across a lifetime and $50 billion in squandered riches are rolled to the curb each year. But our bins are just the starting point for a strange, impressive, mysterious, and costly journey that may also represent the greatest untapped opportunity of the century.</p>
<p>In <em>Garbology</em>, Edward Humes investigates trash—what’s in it; how much we pay for it; how we manage to create so much of it; and how some families, communities, and even nations are finding a way back from waste to discover a new kind of prosperity. Along the way , he introduces a collection of garbage denizens unlike anyone you’ve ever met: the trash-tracking detectives of MIT, the bulldozer-driving sanitation workers building Los Angeles’ Garbage Mountain landfill, the artists residing in San Francisco’s dump, and the family whose annual trash output fills not a dumpster or a trash can, but a single mason jar.</p>
<p><em>Garbology</em> reveals not just what we throw away, but who we are and where our society is headed. Waste is the one environmental and economic harm that ordinary working Americans have the power to change—and prosper in the process.</p>
<p><em>Garbology</em> is raising awareness of trash consumption and is sparking community-wide action through One City One Book programs around the country.</p>
<p><strong>WSU used Garbology in several first-year and other classes as a way for students from a variety of disciplines to interact academically.  Buy the book or a digital copy today!</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Tuesday, November 4, 7 pm, Heald G3</strong>
			Movie people are legendarily liberal and left-leaning, particularly when it comes to the environment. <em>Greenlit</em> puts their commitment to the test as filmmaker Miranda Bailey (executive producer of <em>The Squid and the Whale</em>) follows the production of <em>The River Why</em>, as it attempts to keep an environmentally friendly set thanks to the supervision of a “green” consultant. What starts off with great enthusiasm quickly devolves into something more challenging and insightful in this 2009 documentary.

	<li class="cascaded-item"><h6>Campus Event: “One Thing Challenge”
			<p><strong>November 12-24</strong></h6>
			Each November for the past several years, students living in WSU’s residence halls have challenged their counterparts in UW residence halls in a “One Thing” challenge: which campus has up the most residents who commit to change one habit for two weeks in an effort to add to environmental sustainability. This year, the entire WSU campus—students, faculty, staff, departments, campus groups and units—will have an opportunity to take on this challenge. What will yours be? And how sustainable is this as a practice for you to continue beyond the two weeks?</p></li>
	<li class="cascaded-item"><h6><em>Waste Land</em> Movie screening and discussion</h6>
		<p><strong>Wednesday, November 19, 7 p.m., Heald G3</strong>
			Filmed over nearly three years, WASTE LAND follows renowned artist Vik Muniz as he journeys from his home base in Brooklyn to his native Brazil and the world’s largest garbage dump, Jardim Gramacho, located on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. There he photographs an eclectic band of “catadores”—self-designated pickers of recyclable materials. Muniz’s initial objective was to “paint” the catadores with garbage. However, his collaboration with these inspiring characters as they recreate photographic images of themselves out of garbage reveals both the dignity and despair of the catadores as they begin to re-imagine their lives.

		<p>Where does that bottle, or leftover food, or old laptop go when you dispose of it at WSU? Our trash is out of sight, but should it be out of mind? Or, should we consider the impact on the land that makes up the Palouse and the people who live there of our waste disposal? What are the ethical issues we should think about in disposing of our waste. This event will include a presentation on these issues by students in PHIL 370 Environmental Ethics and some reflections by Dr. Bill Kabasenche (School of Politics, Philosophy, and Public Affairs), who teaches the course.</p></li>

<h4 class="calendar-term">Spring 2015 Events</h4>
<p>We will again have a full schedule of lectures and other events offered in spring.  Some are on the calendar below and others will be added as soon as the details are set. Already in place are lectures on ephemera and archives, the effects of plastics on human health, environmental racism, and the challenges of waste in the food industry.  We also will be collaborating with a WSU Performing Arts music concert, a WSU Visiting Writers reading by environmental writers, and an Earth Week speaker sponsored by the ASWSU Environmental Sustainability Alliance and the Environmental Science Club.  Also in the planning stages are a talk by Seattle artist Chris Jordan, a panel from the Department of Energy on Hanford’s waste issues, a couple of documentaries, and possible events by about trends and research in design and materials that address waste.  In other words, it should be a full and interesting semester, and I encourage you to consider using the book again (or for the first time) this spring!  To see more about these events as they are set, visit this page often!—<em>Karen Weathermon, Common Reading Co-Director</em></p>

		<p><strong>Ephemera: Yesterday’s Trash, Today’s Archive</strong>
			<strong>Tuesday, January 20, 7 p.m., CUE 203</strong></p>
		<p>Historian and Rare Books Librarian Trevor Bond will talk about the stories we can find in <em>ephemera</em>—printed items that were supposed to be thrown away but weren’t—such as receipts, flyers, ticket stubs, menus, programs, lists, and junk mail. As most printed ephemera from the past and from the present are not saved, what <em>does</em> remain can reveal facets of everyday life that are not otherwise documented. This talk will show how trash can illuminate understanding of a time period in ways not always visible in the official documents that were intended to be preserved. This talk will reflect on an exhibit on ephemera that opened at MASC in the Terrell Library in late fall and continues through early spring.<em><strong> Common Reading stamp available.</strong></em></p></li>
	<li class="cascaded-item"><h6>Archives Display: “Ephemera: Yesterday’s Trash, Today’s Archive”</h6>
		<p><strong>Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC), Holland/Terrell Library</strong>
			<strong>Opening Reception: Thursday, January 22 3:00-4:30 p.m. Exhibit runs through early March</strong></p>
		<p>Ephemera tell stories about the items’ original owner, their everyday life, and he era in which they lived. The word refers to items that were supposed to be thrown away but weren’t—for example, ticket stubs, handwritten lists, junk mail, used boarding passes, and vacation brochures. It can be current slips tossed into a to-do box in the kitchen, or century-old love notes between grandparents as yet undiscovered in a box from their estate sale. This artistic MASC exhibit features thousands of items from MASC collections—1932 tickets to a Greek museum found in a book donated from the Library of Leonard and Virginia Woolf, a grocery receipt, kitschy Valentine’s Day cards from the 1950s, a 1903 totem pole-shaped lunch menu from the S.S. Spokane cruise liner headed to Alaska, chewing gum wrappers, WSU event flyers, and walls and showcases more.<em><strong> MASC is open Monday-Friday, 8:30-4:30. (Verification of attendance will be available at the front desk of MASC throughout the exhibit.)</strong></em></p></li>

		<p><strong>Tuesday, January 27, 7 – 8:30 p.m., CUE 203 </strong></p>
		<p>Is your life too plastic? An average American guy, Jeb Berrier, who is admittedly not a “tree hugger,” makes a pledge to stop using plastic bags. This simple action gets him thinking about all kinds of plastic. Berrier embarks on a global tour to unravel the complexities of our plastic world. As Jeb’s journey takes a personal twist, we see how our crazy-for-plastic world has finally caught up to us and what we can do about it. Today. Right now.

		<p>Our disposable society generates in tons of plastic trash that pollutes our oceans, fills our landfills, and litters our daily environment. It’s more than just a garbage problem – it’s a health hazard. Dr. Hunt will explore the evidence that the chemicals that migrate out of plastics are impacting the reproductive health of humans and other species. Are chemical exposures affecting sperm counts? Egg development? The behavior of our children? Important research is going on right here on the WSU campus. Let’s talk about what we know and the questions and concerns that face these researchers! <em><strong> Common Reading stamp available.</strong></em></p></li>

		<p><strong>Environmental Problems as Social Dilemmas: Social, Temporal, and Biospheric Dimensions</strong>
			<strong>Wednesday, February 18, 2 pm, ETRL 101</strong></p>
		<p>Many environmental problems can be framed as social dilemmas. The classic social dilemma model for environmental problems has been based on Garret Hardin’s (1968) “Tragedy of the Commons.” This social dilemma frames environmental problems as a “social conflict” between self-interest and collective interests. Subsequent conceptualizations have emphasized that many real-world social dilemmas involve additional “temporal” and “biospheric” conflicts. From this view, environmental social dilemmas can be framed as situations in which short-term self-interests of humans are at odds with the long-term interests of society and the biosphere. This talk will review the concept of environmental social dilemmas, and review research focusing largely on how environmental decisions are shaped by temporal concerns (e.g., individual differences in consideration of present vs. future consequences). This event is sponsored by CEREO, WSU’s Center for Environmental Research, Education, and Outreach. <em><strong> Common Reading stamp available.</strong></em></p></li>
	<li class="cascaded-item"><h6><em>Trashed</em> Movie screening</h6>
		<p><strong>Thursday, February 19, 7 p.m., Webster 16</strong></p>
		<p>“<em>Trashed</em>” is a provocative investigation of one of the fastest growing industries in North America. The garbage business. The film examines a fundamental element of modern American culture…the disposal of what our society defines as “waste.” It is an issue influenced by every American, most of whom never consider the consequences. Nor, it seems, the implications to our biosphere. “Trashed” examines the American waste stream fast approaching a half billion tons annually. The film analyzes the causes and effects of the seemingly innocuous act of “taking out the garbage” while showcasing the individuals, activists,corporate and advocacy groups working to affect change and reform the current model.<em><strong> Common Reading stamp available.</strong></em></p></li>

		<p><strong>Encountering Midway: A Barometer for Our Culture and Our World</strong>
			<strong>Thursday, February 26 7 p.m., CUB Auditorium</strong></p>
		<p>Renowned Seattle environmental- and eco-artist Chris Jordan’s photography and digital imagery create strong and often-startling visuals that sometimes stretch along walls. His portfolio includes visual mosaics of tens of thousands of photos composed to make a single statement. Other photos are singular and straightforward—of subjects such as African tribal leaders working with NGOs to create a more sustainable environment, or the wind-blown remains of Midway Island albatross chicks who died—literally—from trash. Jordan writes of his Midway Series, “These birds reflect back an appallingly emblematic result of the collective trance of our consumerism and runaway industrial growth. Like the albatross, we first-world humans find ourselves lacking the ability to discern anymore what is nourishing from what is toxic to our lives and our spirits. Choked to death on our waste, the mythical albatross calls upon us to recognize that our greatest challenge lies not out there, but in here.” Chris Jordan’s visit is co-sponsored by the SEB Arts Committee; more on Jordan’s work can be found at <a title="chrisjordan.com" href="http://chrisjordan.com" target="_blank">chrisjordan.com</a>. <em><strong> Common Reading stamp available.</strong></em></p></li>

		<p><strong>Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC), Holland/Terrell Library</strong>
			<strong>Exhibit runs through early March. MASC is open Monday-Friday, 8:30-4:30.</strong></p>
		<p>Ephemera tell stories about the items’ original owner, their everyday life, and he era in which they lived. The word refers to items that were supposed to be thrown away but weren’t—for example, ticket stubs, handwritten lists, junk mail, used boarding passes, and vacation brochures. It can be current slips tossed into a to-do box in the kitchen, or century-old love notes between grandparents as yet undiscovered in a box from their estate sale. This artistic MASC exhibit features thousands of items from MASC collections—1932 tickets to a Greek museum found in a book donated from the Library of Leonard and Virginia Woolf, a grocery receipt, kitschy Valentine’s Day cards from the 1950s, a 1903 totem pole-shaped lunch menu from the S.S. Spokane cruise liner headed to Alaska, chewing gum wrappers, WSU event flyers, and walls and showcases more.<em><strong> Verification of attendance will be available at the front desk of MASC throughout the exhibit.</strong></em></p></li>

		<p><strong>Hanford’s Waste Issues and Challenges</strong>
			<strong>Thursday, March 5, 4:00 pm, CUE 203</strong></p>
		<p>While Edward Humes does not discuss nuclear waste, the legacy of nuclear waste at Hanford is our state’s most serious waste issue. Situated along the Columbia River, Hanford produced the plutonium used in the Manhattan Project during WWII and into the Cold War period that followed. Sixty years later, Hanford is the nation’s most contaminated site, with 60% of the nation’s high-level radioactive waste; it is also the focus of the nation’s largest environmental clean-up with particular focus on the fate and safety of the storage tanks buried at the site. WSU alumnus Gary Petersen has a long history of work in our state’s nuclear programs, including his position the Director of Communication and Administration at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and his work with the U.S. State Department’s Soviet nuclear safety program. In his current position as Vice President of Federal Programs for the Tri City Development Council, Mr. Petersen works with PNNL, the Department of Energy, Hanford contractors, and the Congress to firm up federal funding for cleaning up the Hanford site. His presentation will cover some of the history, challenges, and future of this very important waste site.<em><strong> Common Reading stamp available.</strong></em></p></li>

		<p><strong>Friday, April 10, 3-5 pm, Todd 216</strong>
			Concerns about marine plastic debris and microplastics, exposure to toxic chemicals associated with plastics, waste management and landfill space, and litter as an eyesore and harmful substance for both marine and land-based wildlife, have become topics of discussion by the United Nations and the European Union in addition to the US Environmental Protection Agency. All agree that the widespread use of plastics demands a holistic approach to waste management. This year’s Global Case Competition has asked student teams to imagine themselves as a non-governmental organization in Brazil charged with addressing issues of plastic waste. Each team of 4-6 students has been asked for recommendations for “best practices” regarding one type of plastic waste to be implemented in the community of Manaus, Brazil. Student teams are very diverse, composed of students from multiple WSU colleges and campuses, with a mix of undergraduates and graduate students whose backgrounds are both domestic and international. Come see the final five teams make their presentations and find out which team will be awarded a trip to Brazil to see the issues and meet those addressing them firsthand. An award ceremony and catered reception will begin at 5 pm. Event and competition sponsored by WSU International Programs. <strong><em>Common Reading stamp available.</em></strong></p></li>

		<p><strong>Saturday, April 11, 1:00-3:00 pm, CUE 203</strong></p>
		<p>Humanity’s ascent is often measured by the speed of progress. But what if progress is actually spiralling us downwards, toward collapse? Ronald Wright, whose best-seller, A Short History Of Progress inspired this documentary, shows how past civilizations were destroyed by “progress traps”–alluring technologies and belief systems that serve immediate needs, but that ransom the future. As pressure on the world’s resources accelerates and financial elites bankrupt nations, can our globally entwined civilization escape a final, catastrophic progress trap? With potent images and illuminating insights from thinkers who have probed our genes, our brains, and our social behavior, this requiem to progress-as-usual also poses a challenge: to prove that making apes smarter isn’t an evolutionary dead-end. This documentary is being sponsored and hosted by the EARThS Conference, a multidisciplinary conference on environmental research.<strong> <em>Common Reading stamp available.</em></strong></p></li>
