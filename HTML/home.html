			<h4 class="crimson">What Is a Common Reading?</h4>
			<p><strong class="lead-in">A common reading is one way to create community connections <em>among</em> students, and <em>between</em> students and their professors, residence hall staff, and others.</strong> Topics in a selected book are examined throughout the year by members of the university community. They spark discussions and intellectual conversations in and beyond classrooms, highlight WSU research and the diversity of ideas across disciplines, and introduce different ways to explore complex issues from a variety of perspectives.</p>
