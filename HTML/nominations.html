			<p>The two-year theme for common reading books used in 2019-20 and 2020-21 is <strong>&#8220;global stability, scarcity, and security</strong>.&#8221;  Every book nominated must align with this theme. Nominators are encouraged to think broadly about topics that could fit this theme; the book chosen for 2019-20 deals with the international refugee crisis, though nominations for that year covered topics such as the environment, climate change, etc.</p>
			<p>Everyone is encouraged to consider submitting the name of a good book that fits the theme and reasons why it would be the best choice for freshmen and other students to read and use in classes and beyond.  By providing the Selection Committee with some basic information, as well as your reasons for nominating this book, you will have made a huge impact on thousands of WSU students across many campuses.</p>
