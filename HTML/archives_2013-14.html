<h2>Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error by Kathryn&nbsp;Schulz</h2>
<hr />
<h3 class="about-the-author">The Author</h3>
<p>Kathryn Schulz is a journalist whose freelance writing has appeared in the <em><span class="mw-redirect">New York Times Magazine</span></em>, <em>Rolling Stone</em>, <em>The Nation</em>, <em><span class="mw-redirect">Foreign Policy</span></em>, and <em>The Boston Globe</em>, among other publications. She also wrote <span class="external text">“The Wrong Stuff,”</span> a blog on Slate (magazine), and contributes to the <span class="mw-redirect">Freakonomics blog</span> at <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>Schulz began her career in journalism writing for the now-defunct <em>Feed Magazine</em>, one of the earliest online magazines. From 2001 to 2006, she was the editor of the online environmental magazine <em>Grist</em>. Before that, she was a reporter and editor for <em>The Santiago Times</em>, of Santiago, Chile, where she covered environmental, labor, and human rights issues. She was a 2004 recipient of the Pew Fellowship in International Journalism (now the International Reporting Project), and has reported from throughout Central and South America, Japan and the Middle East. Schulz is a graduate of Brown University. Schulz was born and raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio, and currently resides in New York state.</p>
<p>Reviewing her book <em>Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error</em>, Dwight Garner wrote "Ms. Schulz’s book is a funny and philosophical meditation on why error is mostly a humane, courageous and extremely desirable human trait. She flies high in the intellectual skies, leaving beautiful sunlit contrails."<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"></sup> Daniel Gilbert described her as "a warm, witty and welcome presence who confides in her readers rather than lecturing them. It doesn’t hurt that she combines lucid prose with perfect comic timing...."</p>
<h3 class="about-the-book">The Book</h3>
<p>“Both wise and clever, full of fun and surprise about a topic so central to our lives that we almost never even think about it.”
—Bill McKibben, author of <em>Earth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet</em></p>
<p>In the tradition of <em>The Wisdom of Crowds </em>and<em> Predictably Irrational </em>comes <em>Being Wrong, </em>an illuminating exploration of what it means to be in error, and why homo sapiens tend to tacitly assume (or loudly insist) that they are right about most everything. Kathryn Schulz, editor of <em>Grist</em> magazine, argues that error is <em>the</em> fundamental human condition and should be celebrated as such. Guiding the reader through the history and psychology of error, from Socrates to Alan Greenspan, <em>Being Wrong </em>will change the way you perceive screw-ups, both of the mammoth and daily variety, forever.</p>

<p><strong>"Mistaken Adventures around the Globe," by Bryan Vila, Professor of Criminal Justice and Criminology</strong></p>
<p>Professor Bryan Vila's mistakes have often turned into adventures. Half a century of stumbles, screw ups and goofs have made him an expert on making the best of an ugly situation. After learning to learn from scores of missteps in hazardous places like the battlefields of Vietnam, the slums of Los Angeles, and the dubious island paradise of Micronesia, he's made a career out of studying deadly errors in his lab at WSU. Based on experiences as a teenaged Marine, a young street cop, and a police chief, Dr. Vila will share his hard-won strategies for embracing error as inevitable, learning to recover with good humor, and wringing good lessons from bad times. Leaving lots of time for open discussion, he'll also describe how his one-of-a-kind simulation lab uses Normal Accident Theory to study the impact of fatigue-related errors on deadly force judgment and decision making, police driving, and counterinsurgency operations.</p>

<p><strong>"Science by Accident: How a Small Mistake Changed the Course of My Career," by Patricia Hunt, Meyer Distinguished Professor, School of Molecular Biosciences.</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Hunt fell in love with genetics when she took her first genetics class as an undergraduate at Michigan State University. She has been actively engaged in research to understand how age affects a woman’s ability to produce genetically normal eggs for over 25 years. Fifteen years ago she was conducting studies with mouse eggs when she saw a sudden and very dramatic change in the data for control animals. After a significant amount of sleuthing, she realized that a temporary worker in the animal facility used the wrong detergent in the cage washer, inadvertently exposing her animals to the endocrine disrupting chemical, bisphenol A (BPA). This was long before BPA became a household word, and this little mistake changed the course of her research, forcing her into new and uncomfortable arenas like talking to the media, legislators, and the general public.</p>
<h6>Thursday, September 19, 7 p.m., CUB Auditorium</h6>
<strong>"Water is the New Oil," the 2013 Lane Lecture in Environmental Studies (College of Arts and Sciences), by Sandra Postel, a <em>National Geographic</em> explorer and freshwater conservationist.</strong>
<p><em>National Geographic</em> explorer Sandra Postel will talk about what we have “wrong” in our current approach to using, managing, and valuing freshwater. What paradigm shift is needed to be able to feed, clothe, and provide sufficient energy for a growing population while also sustaining natural ecosystems and the vital web of life across the planet? Postel’s talk is the <strong>2013 Lane Lecture in Environmental Studies</strong> sponsored by the School of the Environment, a cross-college unit affiliated with the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural Resource Sciences. <a href="http://cahnrs.wsu.edu/soe/LaneLecture/">http://www.environment.wsu.edu/LaneLecture</a>. (Common Reading stamp will be available.)</p>

<p><strong>"Bretz's Flood: Being Right (When Everyone is Sure You are Wrong)," by Lisa Carloye (Science) and Kirsten Peters (CAHNRS).</strong></p>
<p>J. Harlen Bretz was sure the evidence he was seeing as he traversed the scablands region of central Washington indicated that the area had been carved by a cataclysmic flood of unimaginable proportions. The trouble was, better known and highly respected geologists from the East Coast were even more sure the landscape was carved by the massive glaciers covering Canada during the last ice age. Bretz’s story is a dramatic example of how hard it can be to stand up for your ideas when everyone else attacks them as wrong. Dr. Peters and Dr. Carloye will take you on a journey of ideas and show how tenacity, an open mind, and cold hard evidence ultimately won the battle of ideas about how the Channeled Scablands of Washington State were formed.</p>
<h5>October 2013</h5>

<p><strong>"Civility and Indivility in American Public Discourse," by Cornell Clayton (Political Science and The Foley Institute for Public Policy and Public Service."</strong></p>
<p>Congressman Joe Wilson hollers “You Lie” at the President of the United States during his address to Congress; Rush Limbaugh calls a young woman a “slut” on the radio because she advocates insurance coverage for contraceptive care; and Occupy Wall Street protestors portray bankers as Nazis and murderers. It has become "common wisdom" that American democracy is in the midst of an “incivility crisis.” Politicians and pundits routinely bemoan the declining level of political debate and blame it for policy gridlock and the inability to forge consensual solutions to society’s most pressing problems.</p>
<p>Cornell Clayton, director of the Thomas S. Foley Institute and professor of Political Science, is all in favor of a more civil and productive political discourse. However his own research on the topic and his work with the Foley Institute on a series of civility and democracy projects supported by NEH have convinced him that today’s political acrimony is not only not that exceptional historically, but that the relationship between civility and democracy is more nuanced and complicated than most realize. Focusing attention on the causes of social division rather than the style of political debate is critical, but so too is realizing that pluralist democracy requires citizens to entertain the possibility that they may well be wrong about things they hold dear and care deeply about.  Ultimately democracy is a commitment to a process of open and inclusive decision-making, one that might get it “wrong,” and not to a set of “right” policy outcomes.</p>
<h6>Thursday, October 3, 10:30-11:45 a.m., Foley Speaker's Room, 308 Bryan Hall</h6>
<p><strong>"Are Partisan Media Dividing Us?," by Matthew Levendusky, guest speaker at The Foley Institute's Coffee &amp; Politics Series.</strong></p>
<p>American politics seems deeply divided. While elected elites are more polarized than at any time since the turn of the twentieth century, there is a growing debate about how polarized the general public is about political matters. Matt Levendusky will explore the evidence of a fractured public and the role that partisan media is playing in that process.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Levendusky</strong> is associate professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania and he is the author of <em>The Partisan Sort</em> (2009) and <em>How Partisan Media Polarize America</em> (2013). His research focuses on mass level political behavior and the effect that institutions, elites, and media have on political polarization. Join The foley Institute faculty and staff for coffee, donuts, and stimulating discussion. RSVP to Richard Elgar at <a href="mailto:relgar@wsu.edu">relgar@wsu.edu </a></p>
<p>Common Reading stamp available in 316 Bryan Hall following the lecture.</p>

<p><strong>WSU English Department's Visiting Writers Series welcomes Washington State Poet Laureate Kathleen Flenniken.</strong></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/05/11x17-color_writers-series-flenniken.pdf"><img class="alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/05/11x17-color_writers-series-flenniken-thumb.jpg" alt="" /></a>Kathryn Schulz writes, "Poetry, like error, startles, unsettles, and defies; it urges us toward new theories of old things" (330). The Common Reading Program is pleased to collaborate with the English Department in highlighting a reading by Kathleen Flenniken, the 2012-2014 Washington State Poet Laureate. Flenniken began her career in a very different direction, earning a bachelor's and master's degree in Civil Engineering from WSU and UW and working for eight years as an engineer and hydrologist, including work on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. She became interested in writing poetry when her children were small, and it has been her passion ever since. Her latest collection, <em>Plume,</em> a meditation on Hanford and her home town of Richland, was just announced as the winner of the 2013 Washington State Book Award. About this collection Flenniken writes, it is “part memoir, part history lesson, part cautionary tale, part quest. It is at its heart a search for identity, as I have tried to synthesize the truths of my childhood with environmental facts.” In her role as Poet Laureate, Flenniken has a goal of reaching all 39 counties in Washington, and she is especially interested in working with elementary students. This event will be an opportunity to experience how poetry and art urge us to see the world around us in new ways.</p>

<h6>All month, and through February, Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC), Terrell Library just off the atrium</h6>

<p><strong>Ben Smith and Jadrian Wooten (Economics) on “What Drives Demand for Pundits?”</strong></p>
<p>We are inundated by pundits: those who claim expertise in nearly any area. Political pundits make wild predictions about enormous electoral wins. Financial pundits use an orchestra of sound effects to establish the confidence in their pick. But it is well established that pundits aren't that accurate. So, if they are so often wrong, why are they so confident? Is this just an artifact of who is picked to be on TV? Ben Smith and Jadrian Wooten set out to answer just that question. Using language analysis and data from Twitter, they found that pundits are confident because *the audience demands confidence* -- even when the prediction is dramatically inaccurate.</p>
<h6>Tuesday, Nov 12, 7 p.m., Todd 130</h6>
<p><strong>Jaak Panksepp (Baily Endowed Professor of Animal Well-Being Science, Dept of Integrative Physiology and Neuroscience) on “The Historic Denial of Consciousness in Other Animals vs the Modern Scientific Case for Their Emotional Feelings”</strong></p>
<p>Because of the basic scientific value of skepticism, there has been a sustained denial of consciousness in other animals ever since science matured, from Rene Descartes to the present day. This is because there has never been any agreed upon way to fathom the subjective experiences of animals, the way human language allows us to communicate about our inner states. Finally, the "weight of evidence" is on the side of common sense on this issue, but the weight-of-history still prevents most scientists, especially animal behaviorists and neuroscientists, from accepting animal sentience as a scientifically workable topic. This talk will summarize how long-standing biases in the field could be overcome, which may greatly benefit our understanding of the emotional foundations of human nature. The neural understanding of core affective processes, homologous in all mammals, is of critical importance for appreciating how our higher mental processes, and social lives, are constructed through life experiences. Enormous advances have been made in the last half century in understanding how primal emotions are organized in the brain, and how primary-process emotions control secondary-process learning and memory. These provide the essential ingredients for higher-order mental activities, which, unlike emotional states, are almost impossible to study neuroscientifically in animals.  This talk will focus on the battles that are still being engaged on whether other animals do have emotional feelings or not, and how these battles are delaying our scientific understanding of the nature of human consciousness, which may also have great benefits for future understanding of human psychiatric disorders and their treatment.</p>

<h6>Wednesday, Nov 20, 8 p.m., Todd 116 (Auditorium)</h6>
<p><strong>Joyce Ehrlinger (Psychology) on “The Bias Blind Spot”</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?” With this simple question, comedian George Carlin aptly summarizes people’s naturally tendencies to view their own beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors as correct and as the “right” way to think or act. These naïve realist perceptions, then, often lead us to view behavior or beliefs that differ from our own as biased, uninformed, and/or wrong — to see people driving a different speed than us as either slow driving idiots or speeding maniacs. In <em>Being Wrong</em>, Schulz draws upon research by WSU’s own Dr. Joyce Ehrlinger to describe people’s tendencies to have a “blind spot” when it comes to their own biases. Dr. Ehrlinger will use Schulz’s discussion as a launch pad to talk with students about the tendency for people to be blind to their own biases but keenly observant of bias of others. She will also talk about the social consequences of the bias blind spot as well as strategies that we can use to avoid the natural tendency to think ourselves always “right” but view others as often “wrong.”</p>

<h6>Feb. 3 - March 7, Terrell Library Atrium</h6>
<p><strong>Touring exhibit created by the Munich-based White Rose Foundation.</strong></p>
<p>The White Rose Exhibit chronicles the efforts of a student-led non-violent resistance movement during the Nazi period. Under the name of “The White Rose,” University of Munich students led an anonymous nine-month flyer and graffiti campaign in 1942 and 1943 calling the German people to actively resist the policies imposed by Nazism. Seven core members of the group were ultimately executed for the resistance activities and many others were imprisoned. Today, the members of the White Rose are honored in Germany for their resistance in the face of grave personal danger. David Clay Large, the author of several books about the Third Reich as well as <em>Munich 1972: Tragedy, Terror, and Triumph</em> <em>at the Olympic Games</em>, will discuss the White Rose Movement in the context of resistance. A touring exhibit, created by the Munich-based White Rose Foundation, will be on display in the Terrell Atrium until March 7. Large’s visit is sponsored by the departments of History and Foreign Languages and Cultures in conjunction with the WSU Libraries.</p>

<p>The Tunnel of Oppression is an interactive learning experience for all members of the WSU and Pullman community. Put on annually by students and staff from Residence Life, the event’s purpose is to give people firsthand knowledge of the discrimination that occurs today; it is intended to stimulate thoughts, feelings, and emotions around the issues and images presented. The event takes groups on a tour through a series of rooms where different kinds of injustice and forms of oppression are acted out, presented, and/or depicted; this year’s event will touch upon issues such as transgender identity, human trafficking, modern racism, hidden disabilities, violence against women, and economic access to education. After going through the Tunnel, participants are brought into a room for discussion and small group de-brief. Attendees should anticipate spending about an hour experiencing the Tunnel. For more information, see http://reslife.wsu.ed/tunnel. Common Reading stamps will be available for students.</p>

Throughout the presentation we will explore how prisons are used to “right a wrong” and whether our perceptions of justice are accurate. Do prisons truly accomplish our goal to achieve justice?</p>

<p><strong>Lorena O’English (Libraries) on "Making Sense of Those Crazy Pictures in Your Facebook Feed"</strong></p>
<p>The perfect storm of the digital camera, photo-sharing sites like Instagram, and the rise of web-based social media networks like Facebook and Twitter have made photographs and infographics hugely popular. But should those pictures and charts always be taken at face value? Can we rely on them or are they sometimes…wrong? Lorena O’English, a WSU librarian, will show some examples and discuss strategies for critically evaluating that wild picture of ominous clouds over Manhattan that your cousin posted last month.</p>

<p><strong>Chuck Munson (Management Operations) on "Being Wrong in Business: Implications, Lessons, and Prevention"</strong></p>
<p>Mistakes in business range from the mundane to the massive. Marketing flops such as New Coke and operational disasters such as oil spills make big headlines and may cost companies millions. Some mistakes even endanger the public and the environment. But it’s how companies react to mistakes that may provide a longer-term impact than the mistakes themselves. In March 2014, Toyota agreed to pay a $1.2 billion federal fine for misleading regulators. Assistant FBI Director George Venizelos suggested, “Toyota put sales over safety and profit over principle.” This presentation will focus on the value of appropriate service recovery efforts, the potential advantage of applying a “second-mover” strategy, and the value of prevention, i.e. making it “right the first time.”</p>

<p><strong>Michael Delahoyde (English) on "Being Wrong about Shakespeare and the Humanities"</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, we may have been wrong all along about "Shake-speare." Coming to an understanding as to what are the implications of our having been mistaken about the Bard is crucial for our understanding of the humanities, and of humanity. What is creativity? Where does it come from? Beyond the Shakespeare authorship controversy, how we approach the enigma and answer the question concerning who wrote the works, right or wrong, determines how we construct our paradigms of creativity, not just in the arts but throughout our own lives and in our endeavors as human beings.</p>
