<h4>Common Reading Book, Spring Spielberg Movie</h4>
<p>Cline wrote the 2011 sci-fi dystopian novel Ready Player One, which thousands of students on five WSU campuses will use as their <a href="/2017/03/16/common-reading-books-selected/">common reading book in first-year classes</a>. Cline also co-authored the screenplay for the <a href="http://readyplayeronemovie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Opens in a new window">Steven Spielberg movie</a> of the same name, due in theaters March 30, 2018, the day after Cline’s 45th birthday.</p><!--more-->
<h4>Tickets and Streaming</h4>
<p>WSU students with IDs can attend Cline’s campus talk for free. Fifteen-dollar tickets for adults, and $10 tickets for non-WSU students, will be sold through <a href="https://beasley.wsu.edu/buy-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Opens in a new window">Beasley’s ticket office</a> and <a href="http://www.ticketswest.com/venues/beasley-coliseum/4025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Opens in a new window">TicketsWest</a>.</p>
<p>Real-time streaming will deliver the lecture to WSU campuses in Tri-Cities, Everett, Spokane, and Vancouver, thanks to the Global Campus.</p>
<h4>Technology and Virtual Reality</h4>
<p>“This is a very exciting year professionally for Mr. Cline and we plan to make his visit at WSU a highlight for him and for students and the community,” said Susan Poch, Common Reading co-director and chair of the book selection committee.</p>
<p>“Common readings are a great way to introduce students to the university’s academic environment, the power of thinking critically, and the excitement of exploring new topics through discussions and activities,” said Poch.</p>
<p>“The selection of Ready Player One as the shared book is unique in a couple of ways,” said Karen Weathermon, program co-director. “It’s the first time a novel has been chosen as the common read. And, the book taps into topics that today’s students are incredibly familiar with, such as technology that is pervasive throughout their daily lives, and video-game and virtual-reality role-playing just for fun. We believe they will really identify with this year’s selection and Mr. Cline’s presentation, and we are very much looking forward to his visit.</p>
<p>“His talk will be a terrific springboard to our own year-long look at emerging technologies.”</p>
<h4>Cline at a Glance</h4>
<p>A self-described “full-time geek,” “Ernie” Cline was: born in Ashland, Ohio; named after a Sesame Street Muppet; thrown 300 yards by a tornado at age one (no injuries); addicted early to Atari 2600, Space Invaders, and Star Wars; proficient at amassing a large collection of classic video games; and a champion spoken-word presenter of three-minute monologues at the Austin Poetry Slam in Texas and the National Poetry Slam. He currently resides in Austin with his family.</p>
<p>He reports that he suffered an “exploded head” when Warner Bros. snapped up film rights to his first best-seller, Ready Player One, and film legend Spielberg signed on to direct it. Cline wrote the screenplay for the 2009 movie Fanboys. His second novel, Armada, was published in 2015.
