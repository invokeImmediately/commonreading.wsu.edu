				<p>Irom’s talk focuses on Western media coverage of the ongoing Rohingya refugee crisis that originated in Myanmar and has now spilled over into the neighboring countries of Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>
				<p><span id="more-3645"></span></p>
				<p>A specialist in humanitarian communication, he will explore how media builds proximity and distance between an audience and subjects of a story. He will examine cross platform media artifacts, including Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs and the <a href="https://www.iamrohingyafilm.com/">virtual reality documentary, I Am Rohingya</a>.</p>
				<p>Irom earned his Ph.D. at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> in American cultural and literary studies. He joined WSU in 2012 in the <a href="https://english.wsu.edu/">Dept. of English</a>, and the Murrow College of Communication in 2014.</p>
				<p>The presentation is part of an expert lecture and event series hosted by the Common Reading, which is part of the Division of Academic Engagement and Student Achievement in the Office of the Provost and Executive Vice President.</p>
				<p>The topics explored in the series arise from a common book used by first-year and other students in classes and beyond. This year’s book is <a href="https://commonreading.wsu.edu/#about-refuge">Refuge: Rethinking Refugee Policy in a Changing World</a>.</p>

					<h2>About daniel.rieck</h2>
					<p>I earned my PhD in Chemical Engineering at WSU by studying the biophysical nature of the molecular signaling mechanisms that control how the heart pumps blood. During my PhD work, my interest in and affinity for computer science, systems modeling, and visual and written communication blossomed into a new direction toward web development. I now live and breathe to solve problems of design through programming, automation, analysis, and abstraction.</p>
